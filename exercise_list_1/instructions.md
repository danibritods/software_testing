# Exercise List 01
## Unit tests 

1. Make a program that reads a string and prints it.

2. Create a program that prints the length of a string.

3. Make a program that counts the number of 1's that appear in a string. Example:
   0011001 -> 3

4. Enter a name and print the name only if the first letter of the name is "a" (uppercase or lowercase).

5. Read an array containing letters from a sentence including spaces. Remove the spaces from the array and then write the resulting array.

6. Write a program that reads the age and first name of several people. Your program should end when a negative age is entered. When finished, your program should write the name and age of the youngest and oldest people.

7. Make a program that fills an array with models of five cars (examples of models: Beetle, Gol, Vectra, etc.). Fill another array with the consumption of these cars, i.e., how many kilometers each one makes with one liter of fuel. Calculate and show:
   a) The most economical car model;

   b) How many liters of fuel each of the registered cars consumes to travel a distance of 1,000 kilometers.

8. Make a program that contains a menu with the following options:
   
   a) Read a string S1 (maximum size 20 characters);
   
   b) Print the size of string S1;
   
   c) Compare string S1 with a new string S2 provided by the user and print the comparison result;
   
   d) Concatenate string S1 with a new string S2 and print on screen the concatenation result;
   
   e) Print string S1 in reverse order;
   
   f) Count how many times a given character appears in string S1. This character must be informed by the user;
   
   g) Replace the first occurrence of character C1 in string S1 with character C2. Characters C1 and C2 will be read by the user;
   
   h) Check if string S2 is substring of S1. String S2 must be informed by user;"
   
   i) Return a substring from string S1. For this, the user must inform from which position to create the substring and what is its size.

9. Make a phonebook program with Agenda and Contato classes.

10. Create a book loan control program with Emprestimo, Livro and Pessoa classes.

11. Create a program to represent a family tree. To do this, create a Pessoa class that allows you to indicate, in addition to name and age, father and mother. Keep in mind that father and mother are also of type Pessoa.

*For questions 9 to 11, create a text interface that uses exception handling in case of invalid commands execution."
